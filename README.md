# AssetWatch #
AssetWatch provides a personal dashboard for users to aggregate all their investment holdings data into a visual table/or chart to view in one location. This can be very convenient for users that might have many different investments spread across different trading platforms or exchanges. Instead of a user having to log into various accounts to view their holdings, they can see all the data in one location. Furthermore, they can see a sum total of their investments to keep track of their total profit/loss.
